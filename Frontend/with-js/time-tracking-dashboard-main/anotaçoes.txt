üìùBrief
Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local data.json file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the .html file.

Your users should be able to:

Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
