üìùBrief
Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
The input field is empty
The email address is not formatted correctly
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

üí°Ideas to test yourself
Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus

Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can

Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is essential for professional developers
